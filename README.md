## What is this?

This is an app for iOS and Android connecting to the biggest service of movie database, called <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/">The Movie DB</a>, at the same time it shows general information about the movie, user score, actors, and the most current movies. It was created with Dart & Flutter.</br>
Important if you want to try this app, you need to create your own **secret.dart** file (I recommend you create it in lib/src, next to main.dart), it should has a format similar like this: </br> </br>
```
class Secrets {
  static String accessTokenTheMovieDB = 'your own TheMovieDB's apiKey'; 
}
```
</br></br>
